# Domain Naming Guidelines

Principles for choosing localized domain names for the coloring page generator.

## Current Domains

| Locale  | Domain                          | Pattern                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| English | makecoloringpages.com           | [action] + [coloring pages]  |
| German  | ausmalbilder-generator.de       | [coloring pages] + generator |
| Spanish | generadordibujoscolorear.com    | generator + [drawings to color] |

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity over brevity** — The domain must unambiguously communicate: AI/generation + coloring pages

2. **Use "generator" (noun) pattern** — Prefer `[generator] + [coloring pages term]` over imperative verbs. The English imperative "make" was a fallback because the ideal wasn't available. Including "AI" (or local equivalent like "IA") is also acceptable.

3. **Include the local SEO term for "coloring pages"** — Research what people actually search for in that language (e.g., Spanish: "dibujos para colorear", German: "Ausmalbilder")

4. **Keep to ~3 words** — Compound domains work, but avoid phrases with prepositions like "con IA" when possible

5. **Grammatically correct** — The domain should read naturally to native speakers. Avoid awkward constructions like bare infinitives after nouns.

6. **Use .com for multi-country languages** — French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, etc. are spoken across many countries. Use .com for international reach. Only use country TLDs (.de, .fr) for single-country languages or when specifically targeting one market.

7. **Hyphens: follow language conventions**
   - **German: hyphens OK** — German compounds words naturally, but uses hyphens when mixing with foreign words (e.g., "ausmalbilder-generator"). Improves readability.
   - **Spanish/English: avoid hyphens** — These languages don't compound words linguistically. Running words together is a domain convention, not a language feature. Hyphens feel clunky and are harder to say aloud.
